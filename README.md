This is my MASTER’S THESIS PROPOSAL in COMPUTER SCIENCE MASTER PROGRAM

Building an On-Premises Data Lakehouse for Big Data Storage and Analysis

For instructions and Operating Manual, please refer to the file Phongdt_Data_Lakehouse_Final_report_summary_EN.pdf ;
specifically in the section titled "Instructions for Executing Code Commands."

The demo architecture has been built and is available on GitHub:

In the ‘complete-version-1.0‘ repository, I have set up several containers, including Kafka, Hadoop,
Hive Metastore, PostgreSQL, and Delta Spark, which have been successfully tested with Flask API,
Jupyter Notebook, and Power BI. All containers were built from official images on Docker Hub.

Image versions:

• apache/kafka:3.8.0

• apache/hadoop:3

• postgres:11

• apache/hive:3.1.3

• deltaio/delta-docker:0.8.1_2.3.0


The Need for On-Premises Data Lakehouse:
We acknowledge the tremendous advantages and utilities provided by Public Cloud platforms.
However, building an on-premises Data Lakehouse architecture not only optimizes data management
efficiency but also ensures compliance with data security and privacy regulations. Specifically, this helps
businesses meet strict requirements for the protection of citizen data in various countries, such as GDPR
in Europe, HIPAA in the healthcare sector in the United States, as well as cybersecurity regulations in
Vietnam and China.
At the same time, the concept of a Data Lakehouse is still relatively new in recent years, with no
specific standards and limited research applied to specific fields. For instance, in the financial sector,
development processes are still in the research phase. Particularly in Vietnam, where businesses are still
struggling to transition from data warehouses to data lakes, the Data Lakehouse concept remains fairly
novel.
Therefore, researching and proposing an on-premises Data Lakehouse architecture for businesses
that require high security to ensure both efficiency and safety, without relying on external parties, is a
highly urgent and practical need that many companies are currently concerned with and carefully considering.
